#: How long the bridge-title repair may spend on PUTs in ONE pass. It runs

#: before a rate-limit lockout, and each PUT carries its own 10s timeout with
#: no cap on how many there are. Smaller than one tick's usual cost on purpose:
#: a repair that delays the switch is worse than a repair that finishes next
#: pass, and the cadence is 300s so there always is a next pass.
#:
#: THE CEILING IS THIS PLUS ONE TIMEOUT, not this. The deadline is tested
#: BEFORE each PUT, so a PUT begun just under it still gets its full 10s and
#: the worst case is 30s. Left that way deliberately: refusing to start a PUT
#: that might overrun would idle the last third of every pass, and shortening
#: the timeout to the remaining budget would report a starved PUT as a refusal
#: and turn `all-puts-refused` into a lie about the server.
