    cannot read two ways on two screens. The caller appends the pct so it can
    colour it by severity. The countdown shows whenever it is known, not only
    at 100%: a saturated candidate's worth IS when it comes back.

    A known countdown renders in one fixed-width shape, zero-padded, so the
    ``:`` before the pct lands on the same column across rows whose raw
    countdowns differ in width (owner, 2026-09-15): under a day AND under 10
    hours, ``{h}h{mm}m`` (``resets 2h 4m`` → ``2h04m``, ``resets 2h`` →
    ``2h00m``); a day or more, OR 10-23 hours with no day component, the
    day-plus shape ``{d}d{hh}h`` (``resets 3d 4h`` → ``3d04h``, ``resets 3d``
    → ``3d00h``, ``resets 14h 4m`` → ``0d14h``, dropping the minute the same
    way a day-plus reading already does). Routing a two-digit hour through
    the day shape instead of zero-padding the hour digit itself keeps every
    reading 5 wide for any window the API serves today (none past 7d)
    without ever writing ``02h04m`` or ``03d04h`` — neither of which any
    caller or test expects. ``resets now``, ``refetching`` and the
    retry/backoff markers ``reset_text`` names a rolled-but-unclaimed window
    with (``"retry 5m"``, ``"429 2m"``, #325 follow-up) all keep their own
    words: only a string that IS a plain duration (``\\d+[dhms]``, optionally
    two of them) gets zero-padded, so a new marker never needs adding here.

    An unknown reset is a fact worth showing, not a reason to go blank: the
    strategy needs exactly this account activated once to learn it (see
    autoswitch.py's consume-first probe admission), so hiding the gap read as
    "nothing to report" when it meant the opposite. ``?`` keeps the same
    token shape a known reset has (``5h(⟳?):``) so a column of chips still
    lines up — callers compute width from this string, never a literal.

    The one exception: a 5h window with no reported reset AND no usage
    (``pct == 0``, not merely falsy — ``None`` from a caller that never
    passes it must not match) has nothing withheld, the whole window is
    what's left, so it reads its own full duration instead of ``⟳?``. A 5h
    window WITH usage but no reported reset is live and its reset really
    was withheld, and any other window (7d, a scoped model) always keeps
    the plain unknown-reset marker; #325 is what resolves those.
